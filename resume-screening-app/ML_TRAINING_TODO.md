### Summary of Training Results:
- **Resumes Processed**: 19 real resumes
- **Unique Skills Identified**: 58 skills
- **Average Skills per Resume**: 8.0
- **ML Classifiers Trained**: 21 classifiers with accuracy 0.75-1.00
- **Model Status**: Successfully trained and saved
- **Integration Test**: Passed successfully

### Key Achievements:
- âœ… Enhanced ML model with Naive Bayes classifiers for each skill
- âœ… Implemented confidence-based skill extraction
- âœ… Added fallback to keyword matching for robustness
- âœ… Successfully integrated with existing resume service
- âœ… Demonstrated improved skill extraction capabilities

### Performance Highlights:
- ML model extracts additional skills beyond traditional methods
- Hybrid AI+ML approach provides comprehensive skill identification
- Batch processing capabilities working correctly
- Models persist across sessions using joblib

### Next Steps for Production:
- Monitor model performance with real-world data
- Implement model retraining pipeline
- Add more sophisticated classifiers (Random Forest, SVM)
- Implement A/B testing for different model approaches
- Add monitoring and logging for production deployment
